Simple Chatbot using Groq API which is an open-source platform to use different API's. This project involves llama3-70b-8192 model.
The LangGraph allows us to create Chat Agents(multi-agents) with the help of Graph structure.
One can easily understand the workflow of the agent through **nodes** which acts as an Chatbot(trained llm models) and **edges** which dictates how the nodes are connected with each other,
i.e relationship between the nodes.
This project simply involves 3 nodes in which one is an ChatAgent node.The other two are START as well as END nodes.
